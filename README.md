Earthquake Impact Prediction (ImpactSense)

This project predicts the impact level of earthquakes using Machine Learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the best model for deployment.

Project Overview

Cleaned and preprocessed a unified earthquake dataset

Engineered new features

Trained Random Forest and XGBoost models

Compared performance and selected the best model

Built a prediction pipeline for easy use

The goal is to accurately estimate earthquake impact levels based on input parameters.

Model Performance

Your best model achieved:

Accuracy: ~96%

F1-Score: High and consistent

Random Forest performed the best among all models

This shows that the model can reliably predict impact categories.
