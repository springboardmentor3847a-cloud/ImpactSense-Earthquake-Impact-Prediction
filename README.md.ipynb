    "# ImpactSense: Earthquake Impact Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "ImpactSense is an end-to-end data science and full-stack project that predicts and visualizes the potential impact of earthquakes. It integrates live data pipelines, machine learning models, explainable AI (XAI), and a web-based interface for real-time risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project demonstrates a complete MLOps-style workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to explainability and deployment via a React + Express web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "ImpactSense is designed to analyze earthquake characteristics such as magnitude, depth, and population density to predict their likely impact. The project uses advanced feature engineering and explainability techniques to ensure transparent predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Built using Python and scikit-learn.\n",
    "- **Explainability Tools:** SHAP for feature contribution insights.\n",
    "- **Web Interface:** React-based frontend with an Express backend API for real-time predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n",
    "This milestone focused on creating a reliable dataset for model training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "- Simulated earthquake data including parameters such as Magnitude, Depth, Latitude, Longitude, Population Density, and Soil Type.\n",
    "- Engineered an **ImpactScore** feature that captures the interaction between these parameters.\n",
    "- Handled preprocessing tasks including normalization and managing missing values.\n",
    "- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 2: Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "This milestone covered the development of a predictive model to estimate earthquake impact based on multiple input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "- Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "- Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** trained on 80% of the data.\n",
    "- Computed evaluation metrics including:\n",
    "  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.401  \n",
    "  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 18.569  \n",
    "  - R² Score: 0.985\n",
    "- Created histograms to analyze the distribution of predicted vs actual ImpactScores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "- The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.98).\n",
    "- Feature engineering (Depth influence and Population Density weighting) significantly improved performance.\n",
    "- Thresholds for classifying risk levels (Low, Medium, High) were derived using percentile-based thresholds from training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 3: Explainability and UI Integration\n",
    "This milestone focused on enhancing interpretability and integrating a web interface for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explainability\n",
    "- Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to measure feature importance and visualize model reasoning.\n",
    "- Generated **summary and force plots** showing how each input (magnitude, depth, population density) affects the prediction.\n",
    "- Derived class-based performance metrics using a confusion matrix and classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "- Model maintained over 93% classification accuracy when converting regression outputs to categorical risk levels.\n",
    "- Precision and recall exceeded 0.90 across all classes (Low, Medium, High).\n",
    "- SHAP analysis confirmed that Magnitude and Depth were the dominant predictors of impact severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UI Integration\n",
    "- Integrated a **React frontend** and **Express backend** to make the model interactive.\n",
    "- Implemented an API endpoint `/api/predict` to serve real-time predictions.\n",
    "- The React app allows users to input parameters like magnitude, depth, and population density, and receive instant risk assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 4: Final UI and Visualization Results\n",
    "This milestone delivered the final web app visuals and demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backend (Express.js)\n",
    "- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/predict`\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Magnitude, Depth, Soil Type, Population Density, Latitude, Longitude\n",
    "- **Logic:** Calculates an impact score (0–100) using a scaled combination of all parameters.\n",
    "- **Response:** JSON output `{ \"score\": value, \"risk\": \"Low | Medium | High\" }`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frontend (React)\n",
    "- **Component:** `ImpactForm.js`\n",
    "- **Features:**\n",
    "  - User input fields with validation for realistic ranges.\n",
    "  - Preset buttons for quick “Urban” and “Rural” test scenarios.\n",
    "  - Displays predicted risk level and visual feedback.\n",
    "  - Connects to the backend API dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Level Computation\n",
    "The backend uses a scoring function:\n",
