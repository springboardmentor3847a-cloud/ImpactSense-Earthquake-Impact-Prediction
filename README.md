# ImpactSense - Earthquake Impact Prediction

## Project Overview
**ImpactSense** is a machine learning-based predictive model designed to estimate the impact of earthquakes in terms of magnitude, damage level, or risk zone classification. The system utilizes geophysical and environmental data such as latitude, longitude, depth, soil type, and seismic features to assess potential damage and categorize earthquake severity.  

This project helps in early disaster planning, emergency response, and awareness campaigns.
